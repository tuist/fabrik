## Description

Open-source, multi-layer build cache infrastructure for modern build tools with remote caching capabilities.

## About

Fabrik is a high-performance caching infrastructure that works with any build tool that supports remote cachingâ€”including build systems (Gradle, Bazel, Nx, TurboRepo), compiler caches (sccache), and container build tools (BuildKit). It provides a transparent three-tier caching hierarchy optimized for speed and reliability.
